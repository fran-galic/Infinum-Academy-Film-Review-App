## Key Technologies and Tools

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation, enabling optimized SEO and faster loading times.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo` for managing state and effects in the application.
- **Chakra UI**: A design and development tool for building responsive web interfaces, facilitating quick development and aesthetic design.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code safety and maintainability.
- **SWR** and **SWR Mutation**: A library for data fetching with a caching strategy and optimistic updates.
- **React Testing Library** and **Jest**: Tools for testing components and applications, ensuring code quality and reliability.
- **Prettier** and **ESLint**: Tools for automatic formatting and maintaining code quality.
- **Form Control (useForm)**: Managing form inputs and validation using React Hook Form.

## Project Features
